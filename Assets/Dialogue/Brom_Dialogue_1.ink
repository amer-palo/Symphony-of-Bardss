Brom: my work is pretty simple, folk around here arnt stupid enough to stay out after dark, and the town isnt big enough to warrent attention from bandits and the like, hell the Mage guild dosent even bother looking for recruits here anymore. Its a pretty easy job but Ive lost my keys somewhere around here and it makes getting in and out of the Guardhouse... difficult... dont tell my brother. Can I help you with anything else?

*you mentioned your brother earlier.
