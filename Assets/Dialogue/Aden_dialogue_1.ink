- Hello there my friend! How're you this fine evening? #speaker:Aden

* I'm good, thank you for asking. #speaker:bard

- That's good to hear. Did you need anything? #speaker:Aden

* What do you do around here? #speaker:bard

- Well I'm just a farmer, nothing intresting 'bout what I do. Now, my cousin on the other hand, he's great! #speaker:Aden

* Tell me more about your farm. #speaker:bard
->TheFarm

* What does your cousin do? #speaker:bard
->Cousin

===Cousin===
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- His name is Jeff, he's a very successful merchant in the Capital. Built his business all on his own too, and let me tell ya', his dad was not happy about it! #speaker: Aden
-Wanted him t' take over the family farm like I did, but nope! Jeff went off and started his own life. He really made somethin' of himself. It's funny, with Jeff gone I had t' take over both farms.#speaker: Aden
-It's a lot o' land, but that's how the farms were originally, before my Grandpa split it in two. Anyway, it was lovely to meet you, my friend! I'm going t' see if Jon has anymore yellow hive ale left. #speaker:Aden

- Oh, the Farm ain't that intresting. My Grandpa used t' own the land and when he passed, it was split between my uncle and my dad, though it's funny because I'm the one that ended up with all of it. #speaker:Aden

* It must be pretty difficult to run a farm that big! #speaker:bard

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- Not really, both my dad and uncle were really good farmers, so they both had easy systems. I just follow their old schedules, and voila!#speaker: Aden
-The farm practically runs itself. I actually sell most of my produce t' my cousin, he's terrific, a real "go get 'em" fella, y'know? #speaker:Aden
